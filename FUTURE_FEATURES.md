# Future Features & Improvements

This document tracks ideas and planned features for the 401K Tracker.

## Portfolio Change Indicators

**Status:** ✅ Implemented - shown in dashboard chart and gain/loss columns

Show simple growth/decline indicators throughout the app to give users a sense of progress:
- ✅ Total portfolio gain/loss with percentage (shown in header)
- ✅ Per-holding gain/loss indicators (shown in holdings table)
- ✅ Visual color coding (green/red)
- ✅ Historical chart showing cost basis vs market value over time

**Completed Features:**
- Portfolio header shows: Cost Basis, Market Value, and Total Gain/Loss

## Fund Detail View (Clickable ETFs)

**Status:** Planned - waiting for more historical transaction data

**Description:**
Add clickable fund/ETF names in holdings tables that open a detailed view showing:
- Historical price chart for the fund
- Your transaction history for that specific fund
- Cost basis and performance (% gain/loss)
- Share accumulation over time
- Key metrics (current price, your total shares, market value)

**Implementation Notes:**
- Query `transactions` table by fund ticker
- Create `FundDetail` component with Recharts price chart
- Add route `/fund/:ticker` or use modal overlay
- Reuse existing chart styling and components
- Show buy/sell transactions on timeline

**Data Available:**
- ✅ Historical transaction data in `transactions` table
- ✅ Transaction dates, prices, and quantities
- ✅ Cost basis tracking per fund

## Live Stock Price Integration

**Status:** ✅ Implemented - auto-refreshes every 15 minutes during market hours

**Description:**
Real-time stock price API integration showing current market values for Roth IRA ETFs instead of relying on latest transaction prices.

**Target Funds:**
- ✅ VTI (Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF)
- ✅ SCHD (Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF)
- ✅ QQQM (Invesco NASDAQ 100 ETF)
- ✅ DES (WisdomTree U.S. SmallCap Dividend Fund)

**Completed Implementation:**
- ✅ Finnhub API integration (60 calls/min free tier)
- ✅ Auto-refresh every 15 minutes during market hours via GitHub Actions
- ✅ Market hours detection (Mon-Fri, 9:30 AM - 4:00 PM ET)
- ✅ Database caching in `current_etf_prices` table
- ✅ Graceful fallback to transaction prices if API unavailable
- ✅ Price source tracking ('live' vs 'transaction')

**Technical Details:**
- API endpoints: `/api/prices/refresh`, `/api/prices/latest`
- GitHub Action: `.github/workflows/price-sync.yml`
- Frontend integration: `aggregatePortfolio()` merges live prices
- Voya 401(k) still uses transaction prices (proprietary fund)

## Email Automation

**Status:** 🚧 In Progress - Phase 1 complete, Phases 2-4 planned

**Completed (Phase 1):**
- ✅ Transaction notification emails via Resend API
- ✅ Triggers after daily sync when new transactions detected
- ✅ Portfolio analytics endpoint for email data
- ✅ Dark-mode friendly HTML email templates
- ✅ Email tracking in database (audit trail, duplicate prevention)
- ✅ Graceful error handling (doesn't crash workflow if email fails)

**Email Content (Transaction):**
- Recent transactions grouped by account
- Portfolio totals (value, gain/loss, YTD contributions)
- Mobile-responsive design with CTA to dashboard
- Plain text fallback

**Planned (Phase 2-4):**
- [ ] **Weekly Recap** - Summary of week's activity with Claude AI commentary
- [ ] **Monthly Recap** - Month-over-month performance, contribution analysis, top/worst performers, Claude AI market context
- [ ] **Quarterly Projections** - Retirement forecasting with 3 scenarios (conservative/base/optimistic), milestone tracking, Claude AI deep analysis

**Technical Details:**
- Endpoints: `/api/emails/send-transaction-summary`, `/api/emails/analytics/portfolio-summary`
- Database: `email_notifications` table for audit trail
- Integrations: Resend (email delivery), Claude API (future commentary)
- Cost: ~$0.05/year (Claude API for weekly/monthly/quarterly)

**Next Steps:**
1. Build weekly/monthly/quarterly email templates
2. Add Claude API integration for market commentary
3. Create retirement projection calculator
4. Set up GitHub Actions for weekly/monthly/quarterly schedules
