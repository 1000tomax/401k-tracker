# Future Features & Improvements

This document tracks ideas and planned features for the 401K Tracker.

## Portfolio Change Indicators

**Status:** âœ… Implemented - shown in dashboard chart and gain/loss columns

**Description:**
Show simple growth/decline indicators throughout the app to give users a sense of progress:
- âœ… Total portfolio gain/loss with percentage (shown in header)
- âœ… Per-holding gain/loss indicators (shown in holdings table)
- âœ… Visual color coding (green/red)
- âœ… Historical chart showing cost basis vs market value over time

**Completed Features:**
- Portfolio header shows: Cost Basis, Market Value, and Total Gain/Loss
- Holdings table shows per-position gain/loss with percentage
- Account Growth chart displays both cost basis and market value lines
- Color-coded gain/loss columns (green for positive, red for negative)

**Data Source:**
- âœ… Transaction-based portfolio calculation
- âœ… Real-time cost basis tracking
- âœ… Timeline data with historical values

## Fund Detail View (Clickable ETFs)

**Status:** Planned - waiting for more historical transaction data

**Description:**
Add clickable fund/ETF names in holdings tables that open a detailed view showing:
- Historical price chart for the fund
- Your transaction history for that specific fund
- Cost basis and performance (% gain/loss)
- Share accumulation over time
- Key metrics (current price, your total shares, market value)

**Implementation Notes:**
- Query `transactions` table by fund ticker
- Create `FundDetail` component with Recharts price chart
- Add route `/fund/:ticker` or use modal overlay
- Reuse existing chart styling and components
- Show buy/sell transactions on timeline

**Data Available:**
- âœ… Historical transaction data in `transactions` table
- âœ… Transaction dates, prices, and quantities
- âœ… Cost basis tracking per fund

## Live Stock Price Integration

**Status:** âœ… Implemented - auto-refreshes every 15 minutes during market hours

**Description:**
Real-time stock price API integration showing current market values for Roth IRA ETFs instead of relying on latest transaction prices.

**Target Funds:**
- âœ… VTI (Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF)
- âœ… SCHD (Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF)
- âœ… QQQM (Invesco NASDAQ 100 ETF)
- âœ… DES (WisdomTree U.S. SmallCap Dividend Fund)

**Completed Implementation:**
- âœ… Finnhub API integration (60 calls/min free tier)
- âœ… Auto-refresh every 15 minutes during market hours via GitHub Actions
- âœ… Market hours detection (Mon-Fri, 9:30 AM - 4:00 PM ET)
- âœ… Database caching in `current_etf_prices` table
- âœ… Graceful fallback to transaction prices if API unavailable
- âœ… Price source tracking ('live' vs 'transaction')

**Technical Details:**
- API endpoints: `/api/prices/refresh`, `/api/prices/latest`
- GitHub Action: `.github/workflows/price-sync.yml`
- Frontend integration: `aggregatePortfolio()` merges live prices
- Voya 401(k) still uses transaction prices (proprietary fund)

## Email Automation

**Status:** ðŸš§ In Progress - Phase 1 complete, Phases 2-4 planned

**Completed (Phase 1):**
- âœ… Transaction notification emails via Resend API
- âœ… Triggers after daily sync when new transactions detected
- âœ… Portfolio analytics endpoint for email data
- âœ… Dark-mode friendly HTML email templates
- âœ… Email tracking in database (audit trail, duplicate prevention)
- âœ… Graceful error handling (doesn't crash workflow if email fails)

**Email Content (Transaction):**
- Recent transactions grouped by account
- Portfolio totals (value, gain/loss, YTD contributions)
- Mobile-responsive design with CTA to dashboard
- Plain text fallback

**Planned (Phase 2-4):**
- [ ] **Weekly Recap** - Summary of week's activity with Claude AI commentary
- [ ] **Monthly Recap** - Month-over-month performance, contribution analysis, top/worst performers, Claude AI market context
- [ ] **Quarterly Projections** - Retirement forecasting with 3 scenarios (conservative/base/optimistic), milestone tracking, Claude AI deep analysis

**Technical Details:**
- Endpoints: `/api/emails/send-transaction-summary`, `/api/emails/analytics/portfolio-summary`
- Database: `email_notifications` table for audit trail
- Integrations: Resend (email delivery), Claude API (future commentary)
- Cost: ~$0.05/year (Claude API for weekly/monthly/quarterly)

**Next Steps:**
1. Build weekly/monthly/quarterly email templates
2. Add Claude API integration for market commentary
3. Create retirement projection calculator
4. Set up GitHub Actions for weekly/monthly/quarterly schedules

## Other Ideas

### Portfolio Analytics
- Total contributions vs gains
- Asset allocation pie chart
- Tax-advantaged vs taxable breakdown
- Projected retirement value calculator

### Enhanced Voya Integration
- Screenshot upload + OCR parsing (eliminate manual copy-paste)
- CSV transaction import if Voya adds export feature
- Multi-fund support if user diversifies holdings
- Automated reminder to update balance monthly

### Dividend Tracking

**Status:** ðŸ”œ Ready to implement - raw data now available

**Description:**
Track dividend income and reinvestments now that all Plaid transactions are stored unfiltered in `raw_plaid_transactions`.

**Data Available:**
- âœ… Raw dividend transactions with amounts, dates, and reinvestment details
- âœ… Historical data from day one (complete 90-day history captured)
- âœ… Separate from main portfolio tracking (won't interfere with cost basis)

- Reinvestment vs cash dividend breakdown
- Annual dividend income projection

- âœ… Transaction-based portfolio calculation
- âœ… Deduplication to prevent duplicate transactions

**Still Planned:**
- [ ] Manual transaction entry (for accounts without Plaid)
- [ ] Realized gains tracking on sales
- [ ] Cash flow analysis (deposits, withdrawals from raw data)

### Performance Metrics
- YTD, 1Y, 5Y, all-time returns
- Compare to benchmark (S&P 500)

  - Asset allocation breakdown
  - YTD contributions and returns
  - Tax information (cost basis, realized gains)
- Time period options: quarterly, annual, YTD, custom date ranges
- Delivery options: on-demand download, scheduled email delivery
- Professional styling and branding

**Potential Libraries:**

- Template system for consistent formatting

**Tax Documents:**
