## What Was Cleaned Up

This documentation structure was recently organized. The following redundant files were removed:
- Multiple overlapping performance quick-start guides
- Outdated mobile optimization TODO list
- Deferred dividend chart specification
- Redundant summary and implementation guides

All essential information has been consolidated into the remaining comprehensive documents.
